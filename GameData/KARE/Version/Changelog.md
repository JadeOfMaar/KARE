## 1.3.0
* Updated radial intakes:
  * Added drag cube values of the wing boards; made them much less draggy.
  * Added stack nodes to them for ease of placement and drag cube wizardry.
* Adjusted engine performance again:
  * Increased thrust for the Spatha, Gladius and Baselard (and not the Tory III).
  * Extended velocity range and peak thrust multiplier of Tory III.
  * Retracted velocity range and peak thrust multiplier of Gladius.

## 1.2.0
* Added drag cube fix. Might be helpful.
* Adjusted engine performance (traded closed cycle Isp for better atmo thrust; increased closed cycle thrust).

## 1.1.2
* Detect alternate Waterfall plume pack: RestockWaterfallExpansion.
* Detect standalone DepthMask mod, not just Restock for DepthMask.

## 1.1.1
* Added FAR config. Fixes CoL problems when involving these Mk2 parts.
* Added missing IntakeAtm patch for intakes.
* Added Waterfall configs.
* Fixed engineID values (changed from Dry & Wet to AirBreathing & ClosedCycle). Some mods, namely BDArmory, do trip over this.
