		#LOC_KARE_agent = KARE
		#LOC_KARE_shockintake_desc = A shock cone intake like no other. We expect to cruise at supersonic, even hypersonic speeds for extreme lengths of time so we need a frontal inlet that can last. With more than just thermal tiles on the front, we even made the effort to squeeze some liquid cooling in at the back of it and through the cone.
		#LOC_KARE_ramintake_desc = A radial intake built to endure the fires of re-entry. It's a safe gamble that this intake might survive while the rest of the craft melts.
		
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-mk2_title = ANP-09 "Spatha" Atomic TurboRamjet
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-mk2_desc = The Spatha is basically a pumped up Gladius in a Mk2 frame. More power, with lifting surface and better passive cooling due to the nozzle cowling providing some decent passive radiator area.
		
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-s1-01_title = ANP-04 "Tory III" Atomic Ramjet
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-s1-01_desc = A relatively early, rather, mid-tier development, the Tory III is an embodiment of peak performance for small nuclear ramjets. There might actually be some black magic involved here as it offers a partially flattened power curve and a potential cruise speed of somewhere within Mach 5. This engine may need a bit of coaxing from a booster of some sort due to its low static thrust.
		
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-s1-02_title = ANP-08 "Gladius" Atomic TurboRamjet
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-s1-02_desc = Eventually, after getting a stable ramjet which is the Tory III, we sought to integrate a thermal driven turbine assembly ahead of the reactor. This greatly improves static thrust and peak performance at Mach 3, but at the cost of sheer mass, complexity, and lower top cruise speed. Oh, and the Gladius can overheat very quickly so be modest with the throttle.
		
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-s2_title = ANP-13 "Baselard" Atomic TurboRocket
		#LOC_KARE_ntj-s2_desc = It's painful to think about how much liquid cooling is involved in this monster of an engine. There is so much so that we wonder if we've crossed the line between machinery and organism. This sword-named engine was originally meant to be firstly a ramjet, but compromised for better low speed thrust, and now involves a turbine assembly that's not particularly large compared to the Spatha, and is dedicated to providing the liquid fuel flow for the vacuum rocket mode... It still helps in atmosphere and helps with static thrust, which is a great plus.
		
		#LOC_KARE_ramintake-mk2_title = ANP Reinforced Mk2 Radial Ram Intake
		#LOC_KARE_ramintake-s1_title = ANP Reinforced Mk1 Radial Ram Intake
		
		#LOC_KARE_shockintake-mk2_title = ANP Reinforced Mk2 Shock Cone Intake
		#LOC_KARE_shockintake-s1_title = ANP Reinforced Mk1 Shock Cone Intake
		#LOC_KARE_shockintake-s2_title = ANP Reinforced 2.5m Shock Cone Intake
